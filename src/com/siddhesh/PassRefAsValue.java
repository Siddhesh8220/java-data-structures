    // when we pass variable by ref in c we pass the address as &a so call by reference
    // but in java we are not passing address we are passing reference of the variable as a value, so it is passing ref as a value not call by reference
    // In Java programming language, arrays are objects which are dynamically created, and may be assigned to variables of type Object.
